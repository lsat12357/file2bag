to use cpd printer script:
export metadata sheet to tab-delim .txt, check utf and line endings
this script only cares about the first three cols, which should be:
dmrec TAB filename TAB title TAB ...

Save in printcpds folder

open a terminal, cd to printcpds directory, enter command:
php print_cpds.php metadatafilename.txt

for example 
php print_cpds.php testcpdprinter.txt

the script should print the .cpds and put them in the current directory;
move the .cpds to the directory where the children are- the collection folder with 
the digital items.

ready to bag!

bag the images and metadata:
open a terminal 
cd /Users/Shared/cdm2bag-master 
./tdv2bag -s -m tdv.yml path-to-filename path-to-images-dir path-to-bags 
[Example: ./tdv2bag -s -m tdv.yml /Users/lib-uberscan/uo_ath_jcs/
uo-athletics_filename.txt /Volumes/DigitalProjects/uo-athletics/
Work/All2upload_2015-01-09/All2upload/]

notes regarding the arguments: The first path includes the metadata
file. eg /Users/lib-uberscan/uo-ath_jcs/uo-athletics_filename.txt The second path
is somewhat optional; if not included, the bagging script will generate
the bags without the images. The third path is optional; default
location for the bags is in cdm2bag-master/bags. The script will
automatically generate a top directory named after the collection (eg
uo-athletics), and then write the bags to that directory.

Rename or move this directory (eg uo-athletics_01) before
running additional bags, or the script will err.

After bagging look at bags make sure everything looks ok.

Important: Move the cpds into a separate folder in bags. Tar/transfer/untar/set permissions for the children first then the cpds.

navigate to main bags directory and tar the bags: 
tar -cvzf dirname.tar.gz dirname 
[Example: tar -cvzf uo-athletics_01.tar.gz uo-athletics_01]

transfer to lib-hydra1.library.oregonstate.edu:
scp tarname.tar.gz yourname@lib-hydra1.library.oregonstate.edu:/data1/batch/

ssh into lib-hydra1:
ssh yourname@lib-hydra1.library.oregonstate.edu 
cd /data1/batch 
ls 
tar -xf tarname.tar.gz 

check permissions (directories should be 775, files should be 664) [Example: ls -l uo-athletics_01]
chmod 775 maindir [Example: chmod 775 uo-athletics_01]
chmod 775 maindir/*  [Example: chmod 775 uo-athletics_01/*]
chmod 775 maindir/*/data  [Example: chmod 775 uo-athletics_01/*/data]
chmod 664 maindir/*/*.txt  [Example: chmod 664 uo-athletics_01/*/*.txt]
chmod 664 maindir/*/*.nt  [Example: chmod 664 uo-athletics_01/*/*.nt]
chmod 664 maindir/*/data/* [Example: chmod 664 uo-athletics_01/*/data/*]

Repeat for the cpds. Ingest the children first then the cpds. Review the children first then the cpds.
