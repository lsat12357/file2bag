to use cpd printer script:
export metadata sheet to tab-delimited text file
file must have encoding UTF-8 and unix line-endings
this script only cares about the first three cols, which should be:
dmrec TAB filename TAB title TAB ...

to run: php print_cpds.php metadatafilename.txt

the script should print the .cpds and put them in the current directory;
move the .cpds to the directory containing the rest of the content files (images, pdfs, etc)

ready to bag!

Notes regarding the dmrec number: this number must be unique within a collection.
